## Creating a pull request
Fork the repo, make your changes, and open a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch.
Do not open PRs to other branches; they are auto-generated by the build.
GitHub Actions runs `make test` on every PR.
Run `make test` locally before submitting, or run `make beautify` to auto-format your changes.
Briefly explain what you changed and why in the PR description.
Maintainers will review PRs, provide feedback, and approve, decline, or request changes.
If accepted, the PR is squashed and merged into `main`, the version is bumped, and a new release is published.
